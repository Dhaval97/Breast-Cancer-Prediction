# Breast Cancer Prediction
Breast Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning with GUI

### Description
* Machine learning in healthcare aids the humans to process huge and complex medical datasets and then analyze them into clinical insights.
* This then can further be used by physicians in providing medical care.
* Hence machine learning when implemented in healthcare can leads to increased patient satisfaction.
* Instead of diagnosis, when a disease prediction is implemented using certain machine learning predictive algorithms then healthcare can be made smart.
* Some cases can occur when early diagnosis of a disease is not within reach. Hence disease prediction can be effectively implemented.
* As widely said "Prevention is better than cure", prediction of diseases and epidemic outbreak would lead to an early prevention of an occurrence of a disease.

### Dataset
* Main Website **UCI Machine Learning Repository** -> https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php
* Dataset link -> https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Original%29

### About
* Used **Python3** for coding and Python's **Tkinter** package for building GUI support
* Used **RandomForestClassifier** from sklearn for training the dataset.
  * Random Forest is a machine learning algorithm that operates by constructing multiple decision trees.
  * The final decision is made based on the majority of the trees and is chosen by the random forest.
  * A decision tree is a tree-shaped diagram used to determine a course of action. Each branch of the tree represents a possible decision, occurrence, or reaction.
